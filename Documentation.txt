The purpose of the project (what it provides for your customers, who are your possible customers, etc.).

The purpose of the project was so students around campus can fill out a survey that would provide feedback on multiple things revolving around the dining halls.These will include What their favorite dining hall is, what time do they like to eat at, what beverage do the prefer, what their favorite type of cuisine is, what temperature do they prefer there food to be at, what their favorite dessert is, where do they prefer to eat, and a spot for feedback.We will then take in the data and allow the user to search and sort for the results.

Short plan. You use Scrum methodology, so it should outline actions planned for every 1-4 weeks sprint
Our Scrum methodology was that we would break it into 4 sprints. Sprint 1 would be deciding the project and team logistics. Sprint 2 was setting up jira. Sprint 3 was to Adjust team roles ,define Jira and reassess. Sprint 4 was to execute all Jira stories to develop, test, and document the final project..

List of necessary tools for realization (you are not restricted with technology that we learned)
Github to share our code as a team
Wufoo to get our data from the form
Discord for communication
Jira to help our team stay on track and have clear goals
Paper and pencil to help draw out some of our plans

Instructions how user should use your program
First the user should run the main file. This will update the database to be up to date. After the user sees in the terminal “Inserted (number) forms into the database.” Then the user should run the app.py which will display the gui to the user. 
The user can now sort through all the entries and sort them by each category.

If something was planned but not done, describe why it was not done
We were planning on doing specific food items for the individual halls but the menus in each hall were just too big and we thought it wouldn't give us the data we really wanted.

Write the API in documentation so I can run your program.
