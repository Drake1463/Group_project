Overview:
    This program pulls data from Wufoo forms and stores it into an SQLite database.

What the Program Does:
    - It connects to a Wufoo form using the Wufoo API to obtain form entries.
    - It saves the data into an SQLite database, which contains a table to hold the
    form responses (such as Dining Hall ratings, meal details, and feedback).

How It Works:

1. WufooAPIClient Class:
    Purpose:
        - This class is responsible for interacting with the Wufoo API to retrieve
        form entries.
    What It Does:
        - Takes an API key as input from the file (secret.txt). Then sends a request
        to the Wufoo API to
           get the form data. Finally, it returns the data from the form as a list of
           entries or as an empty list if something goes wrong.

2. Database Class:
    Purpose:
        - This class handles interactions with the SQLite database, and it includes creating
        tables and inserting data.
    What It Does:
        - Creates a table called DiningHall_Rating (if it doesn't already exist) with columns
        like DiningHall, Mealtime, Beverage, Cuisine, FoodTemp, Dessert, Dinning, and Feedback.
        - Inserts the retrieved form data into the DiningHall_Rating table.

3. Main Function:
    Purpose:
        - This function orchestrates the flow of the program, managing data retrieval and storage.
    What It Does:
        - Reads the API key from the secret.txt file.
        - Uses the WufooAPIClient to obtain data from the Wufoo form.
        - If data is successfully retrieved, it uses the Database class to store the entries in the database.
        - If no data is retrieved or there is an error, it prints an appropriate error message.

Files Used:
    - secret.txt: Contains the API key needed to access the Wufoo form.
    - BSU_Reviews.db: This is the SQLite database file where the form data will be stored.

How to Run the Program:
1. Have the secret.txt file in the same directory as the program,and make sure it has the API key.
2. Run the program, and it will connect to the Wufoo form, obtain the forms, and save them in the
   BSU_Reviews.db database.

Expected Output:
- The program will print "Successfully authenticated!" when the API request succeeds.
- If form data is retrieved, the program will print how many forms were inserted
 into the database.
- If there is an issue with the API key or database error messages will be sent to the terminal.
 Error Codes:
    - "Error: secret.txt was not found. Better go find it. :)" if the API key file is missing.
    - "Failed to authenticate. Status code: #. No entries retrieved from the Wufoo form." if the
    request fails or the forms are empty.
    - "Inserted # forms into the database." if entries are successfully saved to the database.
    - "No entries retrieved from the Wufoo form. Sad :(" if no data is retrieved.
