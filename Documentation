Overview:
    This program pulls data from Wufoo forms and stores it into an SQLite database.

What the Program Does:
    Fetches data by getting entries from Wufoo forms. It then saves the data from the Wufoo form
    into a local SQLite database for easy access.

How It Works:

1. WufooAPIClient Class:
    Purpose:
        This class helps the program to communicate with the Wufoo API and fetch form entries.
    What It Does:
        Takes an API key as input from the file (secret.txt). Then sends a request to the Wufoo API to
        get the form data. Finally it returns the data from the form as a list of entries or as an empty
        list if something goes wrong.

2. Database Class:
    Purpose:
        This class is responsible for managing the SQLite database.
    What It Does:
        It sets up tables in the database if they doesn’t already exist. The tables are used to store
        the Wufoo form data and then the table inserts data from the form entries (name, rating, time,
        feedback) into the database.

3. Main Function:
    Purpose:
        This is the main part of the program that puts all the files together.
    What It Does:
        Reads the API key from a file called (secret.txt). It uses the WufooAPIClient to fetch form data.
        If data is retrieved successfully, it uses the Database class to save this data into the database.
        If no data is retrieved, it prints an error message that tells the user of the problem.

Files Used:
    secret.txt: This file contains the API key needed to access the Wufoo form.
    *****WufooData.db: This is the SQLite database where the form data will be saved.***** (STILL NEEDS TO BE COMPLETED)

How to Run the Program:
    secret.txt: This file contains your API key (you get this from Wufoo).
    WufooData.db: This is where the data will be stored.
    Once you have those files, you can run the program.

Expected Output:
    The program will print "Successfully authenticated!" when the data is successfully fetched from the Wufoo API.
    A message saying that the data was inserted into the database.
    If there’s an issue it will print an error message.
    Example: "Error: secret.txt was not found." if the API key file is missing.
    Example: "Failed to authenticate. Status code: # . No entries retrieved from the Wufoo form.
